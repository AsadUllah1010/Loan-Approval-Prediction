# Introduction
Loan Approval Prediction is one of the problems that Machine Learning has solved in fintech businesses like banks and financial institutions. Loan approval prediction means using credit history data of the loan applicants and algorithms to build an intelligent system that can determine loan approvals. Loan approval prediction involves the analysis of various factors, such as the applicant’s financial history, income, credit rating, employment status, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging historical loan data and applying machine learning algorithms, businesses can build models to determine loan approvals for new applicants.
# Features
The dataset includes various details about loan seekers including their personal and financial information, such as gender, marital status, education level, income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, property size and loan approval status.
# Usage
Jupyter Notebook.
# Conclusion
To fill in the missing values of numerical columns, we have to choose appropriate measures:
<br>
1. We can fill in the missing values of the loan amount column with the median value. The median is an appropriate measure to fill in missing values when dealing with skewed distributions or when outliers are present in the data;
2. We can fill in the missing values of the loan amount term column with the mode value of the column. Since the term of the loan amount is a discrete value, the mode is an appropriate metric to use;
<br>
3. We can fill in the missing values of the credit history column with the mode value. Since credit history is a binary variable (0 or 1), the mode represents the most common value and is an appropriate choice for filling in missing values.
